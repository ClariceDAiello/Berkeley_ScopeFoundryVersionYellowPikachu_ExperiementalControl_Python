Saves by default 4 channels, that can be of type
Counter 
Analog

Other channel types (ex: Camera, Spectrometer) need to be programmed.

Rename this folder to something like 
MasterConfiguration 

Make a list of variables that can be scanned;
variables different than the ones appearing in hardware will not work



By default, 2 counter and 2 analog channels
at particular ports, here (...)
PLUS 2 ANALOG out channels for beam scan








for counter channels can use 
ai/SampleClock (slow up to 1MHz if reading 2 ai channels; if reading 1 AI channel, 2MHZ)
10MHzRefClock
20MHzTimebase
100MHzTimebase

Right now I know its piossible to use the 20MHzTimebase

100MHzTimebase is not possible with current pmts:


PMT H7421-40 has output pulse width of 30ns (confirmed with scope), 70ns pulse pair resolution,
so that using 100MHz gets DAC error: many clock cycles under 1 pulse
PMT R6094 has a 10ns pulse, and could in principle be used with the 100MHzTimebase

ao/SampleClock is limiting factor,
1MHz for reading 2 AI channels, 2MHZ max for reading 1 AI
AO clock (max 2.86MHz) cannot logically be faster than the ao/SampleClock 

triggering on AI line because
"AI trigger is sample and hold"
"AO triggger starts to update output" 


For the program to work, Zeiss -> USerPreferences -> MAgnification Display
should be set to Polaroid 545. The horizontal film size of Polaroid 545 is 114.22 mm, which hasto 
correspond to total horizontal FOV

By choice, we are working at highest clock rate for AI, which will be the highest clock rate for AO

If you need to acquire both InLens and SE2 (or two other detectors), need to go to Zeiss -> Image -> Dual Image

Recommend that turn the sleep time on the Zeiss computer to NEVER - otherwise the connection to FoundryScope will be lost.

TROUBLESHOOTING

If the computer fails to recognize the DAQ, computer needs to be restarted
